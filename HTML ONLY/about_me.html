    <h1> ALL ABOUT ME MYSELF AND I</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Hello, and welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share a bit about myself with you. My name is Charls Aldrin R. Alcantara in short C.A.R.A, and I'm a 20 y/o, 3rd year BSIT student at LNU-Dagupan. Life, for me, is an incredible journey filled with experiences, passions, and endless opportunities for growth. As you delve into this space, you'll get to know the various facets of my life, my interests, and the things that make me tick. So, grab a virtual seat, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together. I hope you find my story engaging and, perhaps, a source of inspiration along the way. Enjoy the ride!</p>
